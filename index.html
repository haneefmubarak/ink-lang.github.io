title: JAYFOR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
---

<h2>What is Jayfor?</h2>
Jayfor is a compiled programming language implemented in C with an LLVM backend. We created Jayfor because we love C, but there
are some flaws that we want to address:
<ul>
	<li>No built-in boolean type</li>
	<li>Dangling Pointers</li>
	<li>No strings</li>
	<li>Inconsistent Error Handling</li>
</ul>
We hope to eliminate these problems in Jayfor. We aren't necessarily aiming at security at a Rust level, but we are going for a more user
friendly language than C, something that makes sense.

<h2>Jayfor's Goals</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Speed &mdash; We'd like a fairly fast language</li>
	<li>Simplicity &mdash; We want it to be simple, and make sense</li>
	<li>Cleaner syntax &mdash; It should roll off the tongue</li>
	<li>Experiment &mdash; We want to experiment with new ideas</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it looks</h2>
<pre>use stdio.j4;

fn main(): int {
	println("hello, world.");
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<h2>Status</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Jayfor is still in development</li>
	<li>The compiler is written in C</li>
	<li>LLVM is used for the backend</li>
</ul>
